# VSCode Flutter Web Container

A minimal Flutter Web Development setup.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter Web application development.

Just clone this repo, build it as Dev Container from VSCode and start
debugging [F5]. A new empty tab will pop in your Chrome/ium browser.
Click once on dart icon browser extension to see the sample counter page.

At the first debug after a dev container is build, it takes some 
time to download the Web SDK.

Thats it!!

To create or deploy own project to a Dev Container, the only necessary
folders are .vscode and .devcontainer
